    "#### Modeling Sub-Document Attention Using Viewport Time\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**:\n",
    "    - While framework for websites have gotten better, companies are obsessed with collecting as much data as possible about their users.\n",
    "    - Instead of sticking to a few proven metrics, they throw the entire kitchen sink at it leading to very resource intense website.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Contribution Type**:\n",
    "    - Data set or analysis.\n",
    "    - Theory and modelling.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Scope**:\n",
    "    - Using the viewport time metric, which is relatively simplistic.\n",
    "        - The time a page HTML component is visible on the user display.\n",
    "        - Assumes a linear and vertical component arrangement.\n",
    "    - To achieve similar results as expensive lab-based eyetracking studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach**:\n",
    "    - Reading estimate models:\n",
    "        - UAM: Uniform Attention Model (baseline)\n",
    "            - Naive model that assumed attention is divided uniformly across each component.\n",
    "            - A larger component means a larger amount of time spent viewing it.\n",
    "        - UVAM: Uniform Viewport Attention Model\n",
    "            - All pixels on the screen have an equal probability to be viewed.\n",
    "            - Dwell time is only assigned to a component when it is within the users viewport.\n",
    "            - User attention is distributed uniformly across all visible components.\n",
    "        - GVAM: Gaussian Viewport Attention Model\n",
    "            - Builds on a eye-tracking study, because assumptions of uniformity seemd too simplistic.\n",
    "            - GVAM is computer similarly to UVAM, but:\n",
    "            - Estimated viewport attention function uses the mean and standard deviation from the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evidence**:\n",
    "    - Validates model results with empirical reading measurements from a cross-language study.\n",
    "        - Study was performed by reading text on paper.\n",
    "        - Reading comprehension studies have found that there is minimal difference between paper and screen.\n",
    "    - Both the UVAM and GVAM models perform significantly better than the baseline.\n",
    "    - The more sophisticated GVAM model outperforms the UVAM model.\n",
    "    - The one clear outlier language was spanish.\n",
    "        - Underlying reason was never identified.\n",
    "    - Note that there is no proof that these models are necessarily better than some other method\n",
    "    - Just that they are able to derive similar conclusions as higher tech solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generalizability**:\n",
    "    - The results were far from insignificant, but I feel like they might have pruned too many users for the study.\n",
    "        - So much so that the remaining people all fit into one demographic.\n",
    "    - I would personally be more interested in ephemral users, or users that only read the header and some snippets.\n",
    "        - Bigger impact on human discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Applications**:\n",
    "    - Maybe this could improve human discourse.\n",
    "    - Not incentivice fake news and ragebait.\n",
    "    - Could component dwell time be used to verify whether the important parts of news articles are consumed or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Outcomes**:\n",
    "    - I had hoped for a less burdensome method of gathering data.\n",
    "        - Chartbeat tool was used.\n",
    "    - Probably very valuable data for the company, but an annoyance for the customer.\n",
    "    - Interesting that you don't need to go high tech to get similar/better results.\n",
    "    - Would be interesting to compare how significant these types of improvements are compared to categories and article titles."

    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**:\n",
    "    - As a frequent user of menus, I had not truly thought about this subject before it was mentioned during the lecture.\n",

    "- **Scope**:\n",
    "- What part of HCI does this touch?\n",
    "    - The speed at which human users find the correct menu and menu item.\n",
    "    - Other similar studies have avoided using zipfian distributions due to complexity.\n",
    "         - This one did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach**:\n",
    "- Main technical idea.\n",

    "- **Evidence**:\n",
    "- What evidence is there?\n",
    "- Is it credible?\n",
    "    - An extensive study was performed using the models.\n",
    "        - Describe the study test.\n",
    "    - Because the design space quickly becomes massive, the trials were scaled down to feasible numbers that fit all three distribution types.\n",
    "    - Something like 16k total trials?\n",
    "    - Is time a descriptive enough metric to make menu decisions on?\n",
    "    - This is how machines work, but is it how WE work?\n",
    "    - There is a difference between distribution types for:\n",
    "        - Menu selection time, zip2 < zip1 < uniform\n",
    "        - Item selection time, uniform < zip1 < zip2\n",
    "    - One ruleset clearly cannot be used for both menus and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generalizability**:\n",
    "- How to utilize this more broadly?\n",
    "    - Different from other studies, this one actually did go the extra mile.\n",
    "    - Praise instead of critique.\n",
    "    - If a menu item is in one place at one time, and in another the next, aren't you just making the whole ordeal more annoying?\n",
